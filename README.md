# Giftastic with Marvel!

In this assignment, I created a gif generating webpage using the Giphy API.

### Functionality  
Marvel characters are the theme of this page. Using text buttons of popular Marvel characters, we locally store the names as strings. Using the Giphy API, we can use an AJAX call to pull gifs related to each Marvel character.  

In addition, the user can add their favorite character to the list of Marvel buttons, so they can view gifs of their chosen hero. Once the gifs are shown on the DOM, we can click to start or pause the gifs as well.

### Built with:

CSS
jQuery

Giphy API
Google Fonts
